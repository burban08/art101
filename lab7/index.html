			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to format a function in javascript. With that, we also learned how to split apart, reverse and put back together something the user on our website inputs in by themselves with no control over the website or the coders. Lastly we were tasked to finally make our own html page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The biggest problem we faces was sorting out our javascript so it actually read and posted on the website. However, through numerous trail and error, we did eventually get it to work and respond to the user input as well!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I believe we gained a better understanding of functions, as well as a good way to doebug a problem solve when you are unsure what to do. As we both threw around ideas to overcome our challenge and grew in the process of understanding javascript</p>
