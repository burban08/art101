					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab, we're meant to modify the javascript to change the appearance of the page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only problem that we've faced was recalling the need to put document. before getElement. Another sad feature that we've discovered is that they don't have comic sans for the font T-T</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We've only faced some personal encoutners during our time outside, the sun was darkening the screen as we worked on the code and we got the chance to get Kira to touch grass. It was fun and still a nice day, even though it was slightly cold.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>:) :p XD</p>
