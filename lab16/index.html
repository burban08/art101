			<h1>Lab 16 - JSON and APIs (XKCD comic!)</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was for us to put in the comic from the API. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the problems we faced was trying to understand the prompt and the rest was more of a personal technical problem. For some reason, as I try to download the extensions needed for the task, my Google did not allow me to download it saying that there was a "Network fail". We tried for hours to see what was wrong, tried Google, ChatGPT, going through my settings, and nothing. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think I need to figure out what's wrong with the extensions on my own time, I'm not sure whether it's just the school's network that's giving me a hard time or something else. My coding is all set, the only thing that I can't do properly on my own is show the comic so this is the image shared thanks to my partner's help.</p>
