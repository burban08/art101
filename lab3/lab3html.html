					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Linking two or more html together, so in this case we are connecting to our image of this lab onto our main one.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only minor problem that I've faced was fixing the size of my profile image. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After discussing it with my partner, we were able to fix that problem after comparing it and checking whether anything was wrong. Then we later tried out a gradient effect for the background color to stand out more. We put in alot of effort as we make sure that we're both on the same pace.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is our final product with a whole new look. YAY!</p>
